# NEW AI - Your Personal Voice Assistant

Welcome to the NEW AI repository, where you can find the code for a versatile voice assistant with integrated animation. This project is designed to provide a seamless interaction experience, allowing users to perform a variety of tasks using voice commands.

## Features

- **Voice Interaction**: Utilizes `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3` for voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities.
- **Web Browsing**: Open and search various websites like YouTube, Google, Gmail, and more with simple voice commands.
- **Information Retrieval**: Fetches information from Wikipedia and provides weather updates using `wolframalpha` and `requests`.
- **Multimedia**: Takes photos using the `ecapture` module and runs an integrated animation window using `tkinter` and `PIL`.
- **System Control**: Includes commands for system log-off and other functionalities.
